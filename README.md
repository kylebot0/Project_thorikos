## Introduction

Floris van der Eijnde's field archaeologist and works in the department of history at
the University of Utrecht. He also works at the Archaeological Fieldwork Project
Thorikos. In this project, the University of Utrecht and Ghent University with
more than ten European partners (for the debrief of the project page 23).
Thorikos former city in Greece (see Figure 1). Later it became
part of the empire of Athens. Thorikos located on a mountain, where many shards
and other debris are discoverable. Between 2012 and 2015, the Thorikos Survey Project
conducted by the University of Utrecht and Ghent University. They have the full
examined south side of the mountain, by shards and other debris to pick it up. Here
they use a grid (see Figure 3) and a maximum of 20 minutes
run by one person at a flat part. With this project, the museum archaeologists and archaeologists learn more
about how people lived in this area. They also find it interesting to
see how their settlements have shifted over time, chronology is also an
interesting factor.

## Description üìù

During this course I created a datavisualisation with D3, my concept is that i'm going to show the most used materials throughout the collection. I'm going to do that with a bubble map.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è

### API request

The app starts with an API request to the NMVW collection API. It searches for a couple of things using a endpoint and a SparQL query. It collects a uri from an object, the amount it appears in the collection and the name of the word. It puts that data in a JSON style object array used throughout the application.


```json
{
        "cho": {
          "type": "uri",
          "value": "https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11840/1033475"
        },
        "lat": {
          "type": "literal",
          "value": "-18.8"
        },
        "long": {
          "type": "literal",
          "value": "169.08333"
        },
        "placeName": {
          "type": "literal",
          "value": "Vanuatu"
        },
        "materialLabel": {
          "type": "literal",
          "value": "proced√©s en technieken"
        }
  }
```

For the real geeks, this is the SparQL query i used. For more information on the query and the data, take a quick look through my wiki.

```sparql
    PREFIX wgs84: <http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#>
  PREFIX geo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#>
  PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
  PREFIX gn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#>
  PREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>

  SELECT 	?lat ?long ?landLabel ?materialLabel WHERE {
          ?cho dct:spatial ?place .
          ?place skos:exactMatch/wgs84:lat ?lat .
          ?place skos:exactMatch/wgs84:long ?long .
          ?place skos:exactMatch/gn:parentCountry ?land .
          ?land gn:name ?landLabel .
        ?cho dct:medium ?medium .
       ?medium skos:broader ?medium2 .
			?medium2 skos:broader ?medium3 .
  		?medium3 skos:broader ?medium4 .
  		?medium4 skos:broader ?mediumBroad .
  		?mediumBroad skos:prefLabel ?materialLabel .

    } LIMIT 10000 OFFSET ${offset}
  `
```

### Bubble map features

- [x] Dynamically renders data
- [x] request via an api
- [x] Ability to size correctly
- [x] Plot latitude and longitude on a map
- [x] Use an SVG
- [x] Choose the medium
- [x] Update the SVG


### Known Bugs

- The only bug that is currently known is that the legend stacks in itself when there are only 2 known objects.

### Upcoming features

- [ ] Linked charts


## Installation üîç

### Before you clone

- [x] Install a Code Editor
- [x] Start up your CLI

### Install the app
```
git clone https://github.com/kylebot0/frontend-data.git
```
Get into the right folder
```
cd frontend-data/src
```
Then just start the application

### Gitignore
My .gitignore contains all of the files and maps you dont want in your application, use this if you're going to commit and push to your own repo.
```
# dependencies
/node_modules
/config
/scripts

# testing
/coverage

# production
/build

# misc
.DS_Store
.env
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
```

### Usage

Start the application
```
Open it up in your finder / explorer
```

Then it should fire up a localhost in your browser, if that's not the case use this in your address bar.
```
localhost:3000
```

## Credits

I followed a tutorial for the legend from: https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/bubble_legend.html. It shows a complete example on how to make it. The functional getData pattern i got from Laurens. It is tweaked heavily so i kinda gave my own twist to it.
